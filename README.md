ChicagoCrime

In 2013, there were over 305,000 recorded crimes in the city of Chicago. Of those crimes, approximately 420 were first degree murders.

This site pulls in data from those homicides (via a CSV file), parses them, turns them into Ruby Crime objects, then uses temperature data from the Forecast IO API and the D3 JavaScript library to illustrate that the rate of homicide increases proportionally with the temperature.
